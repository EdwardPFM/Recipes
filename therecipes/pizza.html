            <p class="p-description">Pepperoni pizza is one of the most popular types of pizza in the United States and many other parts of the world. It starts with a basic foundation of pizza dough, which is rolled or stretched into a round shape and provides a chewy, slightly crispy base when baked. The dough is then slathered with a layer of tomato sauce, which is typically seasoned with herbs like oregano and basil, giving it a vibrant and tangy flavor profile.
                <br><br>The next layer is cheese, usually mozzarella, known for its excellent melting qualities and mild, creamy taste. The mozzarella becomes bubbly and golden when baked, creating a perfect canvas for the toppings.
            
                <br><br>The star of the show, pepperoni, is then placed on top of the cheese. Pepperoni is a type of salami made from cured beef and pork, seasoned with paprika and other chili spices, making it slightly smoky with a hint of heat. The slices of pepperoni curl up and crisp at the edges as they cook, releasing their flavorful oils into the pizza.
            
                <br><br>Pepperoni pizza is often garnished with additional spices like red pepper flakes or garlic powder to enhance its flavors. Once baked, it's typically cut into triangles or squares, making it easy to serve and enjoy. The combination of spicy, meaty pepperoni, gooey mozzarella cheese, and the rich, herby tomato sauce on a crispy crust makes pepperoni pizza a beloved choice among pizza enthusiasts.</p>

                        </ul>
                    <h3 class="ingredients-h3">Procedure</h2>
                        <ol class="procedure-list ingredients-ol">
                            <li><b>Prepare the Pizza Dough:</b> <br>Begin by preparing your pizza dough. In a small bowl, dissolve 1 teaspoon of sugar in 1 cup of warm water (about 110°F to 115°F). Sprinkle the packet of active dry yeast over the warm sugar water and let it sit for about 5 to 10 minutes until the mixture is frothy, indicating that the yeast is active. In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of all-purpose flour with 1 teaspoon of salt. Add the yeast mixture and 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the flour. Mix until a dough begins to form. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 6 to 8 minutes, adding additional flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.</li>
                            <li><b>Preheat the Oven and Prepare Toppings:</b> <br>While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to its highest setting, typically between 450°F to 500°F (230°C to 260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well. Grate 1 1/2 to 2 cups of mozzarella cheese and set aside. Prepare your pizza sauce if making from scratch or have your store-bought sauce ready. Slice the pepperoni if not pre-sliced and set aside. Gather any additional toppings or spices, such as dried oregano and red pepper flakes.</li>
                            <li><b>Shape the Pizza Dough:</b> <br>Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and roll it out into a circle about 12 to 14 inches in diameter, depending on desired thickness. If using a pizza peel, sprinkle it with flour or cornmeal before placing your dough on it to help slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. If you don’t have a pizza peel, assemble the pizza directly on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
                            <li><b>Assemble the Pizza:</b><br>Spread 1/2 to 3/4 cup of pizza sauce evenly over the surface of the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Arrange the pepperoni slices over the cheese, overlapping slightly if desired. If using, sprinkle dried oregano and red pepper flakes over the top for added flavor.</li>
                            <li><b>Bake the Pizza:</b> <br>Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (onto the pizza stone if using) and bake for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. The exact time will depend on your oven’s temperature and the thickness of your dough.</li>
                            <li><b>Serve:</b> <br>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. This allows the cheese to set slightly, making the pizza easier to slice. Use a pizza cutter or a large sharp knife to cut the pizza into slices. Optionally, drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over the pizza and garnish with fresh basil leaves or grated Parmesan cheese before serving.</li>
