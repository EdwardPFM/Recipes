                <p class="p-description">Lasagna is a classic Italian dish consisting of layers of wide flat pasta sheets, typically alternated with various ingredients such as meat sauce, vegetables, cheese, and sometimes béchamel sauce. It's often baked in the oven until the pasta is cooked through and the cheese on top is melted and bubbly. Traditional lasagna usually features ground meat like beef or pork, mixed with tomatoes, onions, garlic, herbs, and sometimes mushrooms. Each layer of pasta is generously coated with sauce and cheese, creating a rich and savory flavor profile. Vegetarian versions may replace the meat with ingredients like spinach, mushrooms, or eggplant. Lasagna is loved worldwide for its hearty and comforting qualities, making it a favorite dish for gatherings and family dinners alike.</p>

                                <ol class="procedure-list ingredients-ol">
                        
                        <li><b>Preparation:</b> <br>Begin by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C) and cooking the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Once cooked, drain them and set them aside for later use.</li>
                        <li><b>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</b> <br>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until it's fully cooked. Drain any excess fat from the skillet. Add finely chopped onion to the skillet and cook until softened, then add minced garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Allow the sauce to simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.</li>
                        <li><b>Prepare the Cheese Filling:</b> <br>While the sauce is simmering, prepare the cheese filling. In a separate bowl, combine ricotta cheese, an egg, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped fresh parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix until all the ingredients are well combined.</li>
                        <li><b>Assemble the Lasagna:</b> <br>Now, it's time to assemble the lasagna. Start by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them. Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce, and then a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers with the remaining ingredients, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
                        <li><b>Bake the Lasagna:</b> <br>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake the lasagna in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
                        <li><b>Serve:</b> <br>Once baked, allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
