        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Italian spaghetti is a quintessential dish of Italian cuisine, renowned worldwide for its simplicity and deliciousness. It consists of long, thin strands of pasta made from durum wheat semolina, typically cooked until al dente, which means they are firm to the bite. The spaghetti is usually served with various sauces, the most famous being marinara (tomato-based), bolognese (meat-based), carbonara (egg, cheese, and pancetta), or aglio e olio (garlic and olive oil).

            <br><br>In its traditional form, Italian spaghetti is often cooked by boiling the pasta in salted water until it reaches the desired texture. It's then drained and mixed with the chosen sauce. Sometimes, additional ingredients such as herbs, vegetables, or seafood are added to enhance the flavor and texture.
            
            <br><br>Italian spaghetti is not only a delicious meal but also a cultural symbol of Italy, representing the simplicity, freshness, and regional diversity of Italian cuisine.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <li>Salt - for the pasta water</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>For the tomato sauce:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Olive Oil - 2 tablespoons</li>
                <li>Garlic - 2 cloves, finely minced</li>
                <li>Canned Tomatoes - 1 can (400 grams/14 oz) of good quality crushed or whole tomatoes, which you can crush by hand or blend slightly</li>
                <li>Salt - to taste</li>
                <li>Fresh Basil - a few leaves, torn</li>
                <li>Chili Flakes (optional) - a pinch for a bit of heat</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Optional garnishes:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
                <li>Fresh Basil - additional, for garnish</li>
                <li>Black Pepper - freshly ground</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Start Cooking the Pasta: Begin by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until it is al dente, typically around 7 to 10 minutes depending on the brand.</li>
                <li>Prepare the Sauce: While the pasta is cooking, heat two tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add minced garlic and optional chili flakes, saut√©ing for about 1 to 2 minutes until the garlic is golden but not burnt. Then, add the crushed tomatoes and season with salt. Allow the sauce to simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes until it thickens slightly. A few minutes before the sauce is done, stir in a few torn basil leaves.</li>
                <li>Combine and Serve: Once the pasta is cooked, reserve some of the pasta water and then drain the spaghetti. Add the drained spaghetti directly into the sauce, tossing well to ensure each strand is nicely coated. If the sauce seems too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to loosen it. Let the pasta cook in the sauce for an additional 1 to 2 minutes to absorb the flavors. Serve the spaghetti hot, garnished with freshly grated Parmesan cheese, additional basil leaves, and a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
