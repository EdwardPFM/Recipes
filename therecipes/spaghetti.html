        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Italian spaghetti is a quintessential dish celebrated for its elegant simplicity and deeply rooted heritage in Italian cuisine. The dish consists primarily of spaghetti noodles—long, thin strands of pasta made from durum wheat semolina. Traditionally, spaghetti is cooked al dente, which means it is firm to the bite, a quality highly prized in Italian pasta cooking.

            <br><br>The sauce accompanying the pasta is where regional variations come into play, but one of the most iconic is a tomato-based marinara sauce. This sauce is typically made with ripe tomatoes, good quality olive oil, fresh garlic, basil, and occasionally a hint of chili flakes to add a little heat. The sauce is cooked just long enough to bring out the flavors of the tomatoes and meld them harmoniously with the garlic and herbs.
            
            <br><br>In its most authentic form, Italian spaghetti is about highlighting quality ingredients. It's usually served with a sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan cheese on top and garnished with additional fresh basil. Each element of the dish combines to create a delightful balance of flavors that are both comforting and sophisticated. This dish not only reflects the Italian culinary ethos of using fresh, high-quality ingredients but also embodies the Italian way of life, emphasizing pleasure, leisure, and family—all gathered around a delicious plate of pasta.</p>

                <li>Salt - for the pasta water</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Garlic - 2 cloves, finely minced</li>
                <li>Canned Tomatoes - 1 can (400 grams/14 oz) of good quality crushed or whole tomatoes, which you can crush by hand or blend slightly</li>
                <li>Salt - to taste</li>
                <li>Fresh Basil - a few leaves, torn</li>
                <li>Chili Flakes (optional) - a pinch for a bit of heat</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Optional Garnishes</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
                <li>Fresh Basil - additional, for garnish</li>
                <li>Black Pepper - freshly ground</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Start Cooking the Pasta:</b> <br>Begin by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until it is al dente, typically around 7 to 10 minutes depending on the brand.</li>
                <li><b>Prepare the Sauce:</b> <br>While the pasta is cooking, heat two tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add minced garlic and optional chili flakes, sautéing for about 1 to 2 minutes until the garlic is golden but not burnt. Then, add the crushed tomatoes and season with salt. Allow the sauce to simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes until it thickens slightly. A few minutes before the sauce is done, stir in a few torn basil leaves.</li>
                <li><b>Combine and Serve:</b> <br>Once the pasta is cooked, reserve some of the pasta water and then drain the spaghetti. Add the drained spaghetti directly into the sauce, tossing well to ensure each strand is nicely coated. If the sauce seems too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to loosen it. Let the pasta cook in the sauce for an additional 1 to 2 minutes to absorb the flavors. Serve the spaghetti hot, garnished with freshly grated Parmesan cheese, additional basil leaves, and a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
